# __all__ = ['model_a', 'model_b', 'some_function', 'another_function']  # this explicitly defines what will be imported
# if someone writes "from NeuralLib import *". This way, outside of this project, one can also write directly
# from NeuralLib import model_a,
# and it won't be necessary to do from NeuralLib.models import model_a
