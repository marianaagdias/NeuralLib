# NeuralLib

**NeuralLib** is an an opensource DL-based structured framework that promotes efficiency, reusability, scalability, and collaboration, empowering researchers and practitioners to apply state-of-the-art neural models to biosignal data efficiently. The primary objective of NeuralLib is to establish a modular, efficient, generalizable framework for biosignal processing using DL.
