# NeuralLib


`NeuralLib` is a Python library designed for advanced biosignal processing using neural networks. The primary objective is to establish a modular, efficient, generalizable framework for biosignal processing using DL.
The core concept of `NeuralLib` revolves around creating, training, and managing neural network models and leveraging their components for transfer learning (TL). This allows for the reusability of pre-trained models or parts of them to create new models and adapt them to different tasks or datasets efficiently.

The library supports:

- Training and testing `Architectures` from scratch for specific biosignals processing tasks.
- Adding tested models to hugging face repositories to create `ProductionModels` and share them with the community for public usage.
- Extracting trained components from production models using `TLFactory`.
- Combining, freezing, or further fine-tuning pre-trained components to train`TLModels`.
